# MERN-Stack-Dev

This repository contains code which I learnt in my MERN-Stack Develeopment lecture which was conducted by Miss. Krishnakripa Jayakumar.<br/><br/>
A React application was created with the use of Express Framework over Node.js as the backend and MongoDB as the NoSQL database.

---
**M** - MongoDB<br/>
**E** - Express<br/>
**R** - React<br/>
**N** - Node.js<br/><br/>

---
MongoDB: NoSQL database<br/>
Express: Framework for Node.js<br/>
React: Library for building user interfaces<br/>
Node.js: A runtime environment. Not a programming language, not a framework
